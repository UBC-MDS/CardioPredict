   abstract = {Editorial The Framingham Heart Study: past, present and future The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is widely recognized for its lasting contributions to cardiovascular epidemiology. In this article we review the study's history, past accomplishments , current research agenda and future research directions. Where we came from With the rapidly rising prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the early 20th century, public health and political leaders of the USA agreed that national investment in research must be undertaken towards CVD prevention. The National Heart Institute, which later became the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, was formed in 1948. Since CVD encompasses conditions with prolonged subclinical course, a prospectively-followed healthy cohort was deemed to be the perfect sample in which to study development of CVD. Thus, in 1948, the U.S. Public Health Service embarked upon the first large-scale cardiovascular epidemiology study in the country-the FHS. 1 Investigators sampled 2 of every three adults aged 30-59 years in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, yielding a sample of 5209 men and women enrolled. Data collected included detailed medical and family history and physical examination, as well as X-ray, electrocardiogram and blood tests including cholesterol and glucose, to detect abnormalities thought to play a role in development of CVD. The initial observations from FHS provided many of the central tenets of cardiovascular epidemiology that have held true over time. Published in 1957 and 1959, the first publications from 4-and 6-year follow-up reported such findings as greater incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) associated with older age and male sex. 2,3 The FHS was the first to describe a graded relationship of CVD with obesity, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol and cigarette smoking. Furthermore, the authors noted that these conditions may amplify synergistically, as cholesterol levels were greater in smokers as compared with non-smokers. 3 The initial findings from the FHS revolutionized primary prevention of CVD. In a seminal 1961 manuscript, Dr William Kannel, who subsequently led the FHS, described the key 'factors of risk' associated with atherosclerotic CVD, including age, sex, hypertension, elevated cholesterol , diabetes and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. 4 This singular work popularized the ubiquitous term 'risk factors' used today and defined key variables determining CVD risk in adults. FHS investigators also introduced the notion of multivariable risk, combining several risk factors into a risk score to estimate the absolute risk of developing CAD, stroke and CVD. The Framingham Risk Score 5 has stood the test of time and remains a benchmark for evaluation of patients in a multitude of clinical settings. FHS also identified major risk factors for stroke, including the key role of atrial fibrillation. As the study evolved, measurements of high-density lipopro-tein [HDL] cholesterol concentrations underscored the car-dioprotective role of this lipid trait. The epidemiology of different forms of CVD, including peripheral arterial disease and heart failure, were also characterized by several landmark FHS reports. Overall, FHS identified the role of lifestyle in mediating CVD risk and origin of several risk factors.},

   abstract = {The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) was established in 1948 to improve understanding of the epidemiology of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the USA. In 1961, seminal work identified major risk factors for CHD (high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and evidence on the electrocardiogram of left ventricular hypertrophy), which later formed the basis for multivariable 10-year and 30-year risk-prediction algorithms. The FHS cohorts now comprise three generations of participants (n ≈ 15,000) and two minority cohorts. The FHS cohorts are densely phenotyped, with recurring follow-up examinations and surveillance for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular end points. Assessment of subclinical disease and physiological profiling of these cohorts (with the use of echocardiography, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise stress testing, cardiac CT, heart and brain MRI, serial vascular tonometry and accelerometry) have been performed repeatedly. Over the past decade, the FHS cohorts have undergone deep ‘omics’ profiling (including whole-genome sequencing, DNA methylation analysis, transcriptomics, high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics, and microbiome studies). The FHS is a rich, longitudinal, transgenerational and deeply phenotyped cohort study with a sustained focus on state-of-the-art epidemiological methods and technological advances to facilitate scientific discoveries. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) has been collecting epidemiological data on cardiovascular risk factors and disease for &gt;70 years. In this Timeline Perspectives article, the authors summarize the major achievements of the FHS, highlight some of the seminal publications and discuss how epidemiological research has changed and continues to evolve.},

   abstract = {There is a growing trend towards data mining applications in medicine. Different algorithms have been explored by medical practitioners in an attempt to assist their work; the diagnosis of breast cancer is one of those applications. Machine learning algorithms are of vital importance to many medical problems, they can help to diagnose a disease, to detect its causes, to predict the outcome of a treatment, etc. K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms; it is widely used in predictive analysis. To optimize its performance and to accelerate its process, this paper proposes a new solution to speed up KNN algorithm based on clustering and attributes filtering. It also includes another improvement based on reliability coefficients which insures a more accurate classification. Thus, the contributions of this paper are three-fold: (i) the clustering of class instances, (ii) the selection of most significant attributes, and (iii) the ponderation of similarities by reliability coefficients. Results of the proposed approach exceeded most known classification techniques with an average f-measure exceeding 94% on the considered breast-cancer Dataset.},

   abstract = {Deep learning is attracting growing interest from biomedical engineering community. Researchers and clinicians are also increasingly interested in development of machine learning and pattern recognition systems used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enhance diagnostic power for AD, we propose an automatic system integrating convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract deep traits from magnetic resonance image (MRI) with no prior assumption, a filtering technique to reduce number of features, and k nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm to discriminate AD subjects from healthy control (HC) ones. The kNN is tuned by Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm. The experimental outcomes support the hypothesis that our proposed integrative system can be effective at performing MRI classification: 94.96% ± 0.0486 accuracy, 92.05% ± 0.0746 sensitivity, and 96.62% ± 0.0350 specificity. The obtained result underscore the utility of the proposed system for screening AD as it improves accuracy compared to existing models validated on the same data set.},

   abstract = {Machine learning and data mining-based approaches to prediction and detection of heart disease would be of great clinical utility, but are highly challenging to develop. In most countries there is a lack of cardiovascular expertise and a significant rate of incorrectly diagnosed cases which could be addressed by developing accurate and efficient early-stage heart disease prediction by analytical support of clinical decision-making with digital patient records. This study aimed to identify machine learning classifiers with the highest accuracy for such diagnostic purposes. Several supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied and compared for performance and accuracy in heart disease prediction. Feature importance scores for each feature were estimated for all applied algorithms except MLP and KNN. All the features were ranked based on the importance score to find those giving high heart disease predictions. This study found that using a heart disease dataset collected from Kaggle three-classification based on k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT) and random forests (RF) algorithms the RF method achieved 100% accuracy along with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Thus, we found that a relatively simple supervised machine learning algorithm can be used to make heart disease predictions with very high accuracy and excellent potential utility.},

   abstract = {Data mining techniques have been widely used to mine knowledgeable information from medical data bases. In data mining classification is a supervised learning that can be used to design models describing important data classes, where class attribute is involved in the construction of the classifier. Nearest neighbor (KNN) is very simple, most popular, highly efficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition.KNN is a straight forward classifier, where samples are classified based on the class of their nearest neighbor. Medical data bases are high volume in nature. If the data set contains redundant and irrelevant attributes, classification may produce less accurate result. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in INDIA. In Andhra Pradesh heart disease was the leading cause of mortality accounting for 32%of all deaths, a rate as high as Canada (35%) and USA.Hence there is a need to define a decision support system that helps clinicians decide to take precautionary steps. In this paper we propose a new algorithm which combines KNN with genetic algorithm for effective classification. Genetic algorithms perform global search in complex large and multimodal landscapes and provide optimal solution. Experimental results shows that our algorithm enhance the accuracy in diagnosis of heart disease.},
