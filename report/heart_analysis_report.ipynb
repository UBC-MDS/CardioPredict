    "In the analysis we examine the development and evaluation of two models, Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The Logistic Regression model, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, demonstrated a modest test accuracy of 55.3% but had a high recall for class 1 (indicating disease presence) at 84%. However, its precision was low, indicating a high rate of false positives. The kNN model, selected based on cross-validation, initially showed a higher accuracy of approximately 79% but a very low recall of 5.17%, indicating many false negatives. After applying oversampling to address class imbalance, the kNN model’s recall improved significantly to 51.7%, though accuracy decreased to 63.7%. The report concludes that while Logistic Regression is preferable due to its higher recall, both models show limited accuracy. Further investigation into the dataset’s features and more refined preprocessing are recommended for improved model performance. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million lives lost annually {cite}whr2023. The global fatalities from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have risen from about 12.1 million in 1990 to 18.6 million in 2019 {cite}whf2023. Identifying high-risk individuals and providing timely treatment is critical to reducing premature mortality from CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assertion that up to 80 percent of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable highlights the critical role of quality data in formulating effective health policies. {cite}whf2023. The report also highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Leveraging date from the famous Framingham Heart Study {cite}fhs, our project examines the potential of machine learning classification methods to assess heart disease risk and identify the risk factors. The dataset contains 1,363 records and includes variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits, analyzed to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease. Given that many cardiovascular conditions present no initial symptoms and are preventable through lifestyle modifications {cite}who, an algorithm capable of accurately detecting at-risk individuals can be pivotal. Early detection is paramount to providing early interventions, which may include lifestyle counseling and proactive medication management, thereby improving patient outcomes."

    "\n",
    "The CardioPredict project utilizes data from the renowned Framingham Heart Study (FHS), initiated by the USA Public Health Service {cite}nih, a pivotal cohort study initiated in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts. In 2018, The FHS celebrated its seventieth anniversary, is the longest-running cardiovascular epidemiological cohort study in the USA {cite}Andersson2019. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) has been widely used for various research purposes. The study has contributed to the understanding of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and diabetes {cite}Tsao201. It has also facilitated the development and implementation of effective treatments for these conditions. The FHS has been instrumental in investigating the role of lifestyle habits, social networks, and genetics in CVD. Additionally, the study has provided valuable data for genomic research, including genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and other 'omics' data types like DNA methylation and gene expression. The FHS continues to be relevant today in addressing challenges such as physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes, and remains an important institution for training CVD epidemiologists and researchers {cite}Andersson2021.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification and Retionalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is underpinned by its well-recognized efficacy in clinical diagnostics. kNN's simplicity and its inherent capacity to discern intricate, non-linear relationships make it particularly suited for medical datasets, where such complexities are the norm. It has gained traction within the medical research community for its successful application across various diagnostic challenges. {cite}Lahmiri2023 utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic feature extraction from MRI images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) based feature ranking and selection is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the CNN-based features. And the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier is then optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm. The proposed system achieves high classification performance and shows promise for efficient Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. {cite}Cherif2018 optimizes the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis by clustering class instances, selecting significant attributes, and weighting similarities with reliability coefficients. The results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other classification techniques, achieving an average f-measure exceeding 94% on the breast cancer dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent scholarly work has showcased the integration of kNN with advanced computational techniques to amplify its diagnostic capabilities in CVD. {cite}jabbar2013 proposes a new algorithm that combines the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method with a genetic algorithm for the classification of heart disease. The KNN algorithm is utilized for pattern recognition based on the class of the nearest neighbor, while the genetic algorithm performs a global search to find optimal solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances the accuracy in diagnosing heart disease. The study of {cite}Ali2021 aimed to predict heart disease using data mining techniques and used a heart disease dataset with 14 attributes to compare different classification algorithms. The results showed that the KNN, RF, and DT algorithms achieved 100% accuracy in predicting heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics and Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the critical nature of accurately identifying at-risk patients, the study prioritizes recall as the primary evaluation metric. In CVD prediction, the cost of false negatives – overlooking individuals who are actually at risk – is exceedingly high, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Therefore, recall, which measures the model's ability to detect all positive cases, emerges as the most pertinent metric for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing and Feature Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "A thorough preprocessing protocol is adopted to ensure the data's suitability for analysis. This includes addressing missing values in numerical attributes through median imputation, a decision driven by the skewed nature of certain variables, notably the cigarette consumption (CIG). This approach preserves the underlying distribution of these features. Additionally, to counter the diverse range of scales across various numerical features, the dataset undergoes normalization using standard scaling This normalization ensures equitable representation of each feature in the model, preventing any single variable from exerting undue influence due to scale disparities. Furthermore, the study incorporates OneHotEncoding for the binary variable SEX with female as reference group. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparamer Optimization and Over-Sample Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model, this study optimizes the number of neighbors (n_neighbors). A cross-validation approach was applied across a range of 1 to 20 neighbors, in increments of 5, to determine the ideal balance between underfitting and overfitting, thus ascertaining the most effective neighbor count for accurate classification. To address class imbalance in the kNN model, we implemented Random Over Sampling (ROS), ensuring an equitable class distribution in the training set. This approach significantly enhanced the model’s ability to detect the minority class, a prevalent challenge in medical datasets with disproportionate class sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the scikit-learn Python package {cite}Pedregosa2012, this research benefits from its extensive suite of machine learning tools. This package not only provides efficient implementations of Logistic Regression and kNN but also encompasses a broad spectrum of data pre-processing techniques and metrics for comprehensive model evaluation, all encapsulated within an intuitive framework conducive to streamlined model development and assessment."

    "In the quest to refine cardiovascular disease prediction models, this analysis reveals a nuanced balance between accuracy {numref}`accuracy_lines` and recall {numref}`recall_lines`, particularly when examining k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) with and without oversampling. The accuracy plot underscores a steadier, more uniform performance with oversampling, maintaining a high accuracy across the spectrum of neighbors considered. In contrast, the kNN model without oversampling demonstrates a gradual increase in accuracy as the number of neighbors grows, hinting at the model's sensitivity to the neighbor parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this study's focus pivots towards recall, a metric of paramount importance in medical diagnostics where missing a true case (false negative) can have dire consequences. The recall plot vividly illustrates the stark enhancement in recall due to oversampling, particularly in lower neighbor counts. The without-oversampling curve plummets, indicating a high rate of false negatives, whereas the with-oversampling curve consistently captures a higher proportion of positive cases. This enhancement is critical, as it suggests oversampling equips kNN to better identify at-risk patients, making it the preferred approach despite potential trade-offs in accuracy. Thus, the kNN with oversampling, optimized for recall, emerges as a crucial strategy for early and accurate identification of cardiovascular diseases, aligning with the medical imperative to prioritize patient outcomes over model precision."

    "\n",
    "In medical diagnostics, especially for critical conditions like coronary heart disease, the priority is often to minimize false negatives as we aim to minimize instances where patients miss critical treatment. Thus, in our analysis we tried different measures to increase the recall. However, the relatively moderate accuracy and recall levels (53.1% for logistic regression and 64% for KNN after oversampling) might be lower than what one might expect for medical diagnostic tools. This could result from the imbalance in class distribution and needs to be evaluated within the specific application to determine whether this low accuracy is acceptable. Such an evaluation should also contains an estimation of the incurred costs, that arise by having false positive/false negatives and approach to minimize these costs."
