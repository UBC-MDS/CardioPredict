    "In the analysis we examine the development and evaluation of two models, Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), to predict the risk of coronary heart disease using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The Logistic Regression model, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, demonstrated a modest test accuracy of 55.3% but had a high recall for class 1 (indicating disease presence) at 84%. However, its precision was low, indicating a high rate of false positives. The kNN model, selected based on cross-validation, initially showed a higher accuracy of approximately 79% but a very low recall of 5.17%, indicating many false negatives. After applying oversampling to address class imbalance, the kNN model’s recall improved significantly to 51.7%, though accuracy decreased to 63.7%. The report concludes that while Logistic Regression is preferable due to its higher recall, both models show limited accuracy. Further investigation into the dataset’s features and more refined preprocessing are recommended for improved model performance. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million lives lost annually {cite}whr2023. The global fatalities from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have risen from about 12.1 million in 1990 to 18.6 million in 2019 {cite}whf2023. Identifying high-risk individuals and providing timely treatment is critical to reducing premature mortality from CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assertion that up to 80 percent of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable highlights the critical role of quality data in formulating effective health policies. {cite}whf2023. The report also highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Leveraging date from the famous Framingham Heart Study {cite}fhs, our project examines the potential of machine learning classification methods to assess heart disease risk and identify the risk factors. The dataset contains 1,363 records and includes variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits, analyzed to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease. Given that many cardiovascular conditions present no initial symptoms and are preventable through lifestyle modifications {cite}who, an algorithm capable of accurately detecting at-risk individuals can be pivotal. Early detection is paramount to providing early interventions, which may include lifestyle counseling and proactive medication management, thereby improving patient outcomes."

    "\n",
    "The CardioPredict project utilizes data from the renowned Framingham Heart Study (FHS), initiated by the USA Public Health Service {cite}nih, a pivotal cohort study initiated in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts. In 2018, The FHS celebrated its seventieth anniversary, is the longest-running cardiovascular epidemiological cohort study in the USA {cite}Andersson2019. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) has been widely used for various research purposes. The study has contributed to the understanding of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and diabetes {cite}Tsao201. It has also facilitated the development and implementation of effective treatments for these conditions. The FHS has been instrumental in investigating the role of lifestyle habits, social networks, and genetics in CVD. Additionally, the study has provided valuable data for genomic research, including genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and other 'omics' data types like DNA methylation and gene expression. The FHS continues to be relevant today in addressing challenges such as physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes, and remains an important institution for training CVD epidemiologists and researchers {cite}Andersson2021.\n",

    "The FHS is also widely used as a source of data for educational purposes in the medical field by National Institute of Health (NIH) {cite}nih2021\n",
    "Our dataset, derived from this study and provided by Professor Paul Blanche {cite}data, encompasses a comprehensive collection of health metrics from 1,363 individuals, meticulously recorded and analyzed to gauge the risk of developing heart disease."

    "Key variables in this dataset include age, gender, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), cholesterol levels, Framingham relative weight (FRW), and smoking habits (measured as cigarettes per day). These variables offer a multifaceted view into each individual's health status, providing a robust foundation for our predictive analysis. For example, 'sex' is categorized into Female or Male, 'AGE' represents the age of individuals in years, 'FRW' indicates the Framingham relative weight percentage at baseline ranging from 52 to 222, 'SBP' and 'DBP' measure blood pressure in mmHg, 'CHOL' shows cholesterol levels in mg/100ml, and 'CIG' quantifies cigarette consumption per day. The 'disease' variable,which serves as out target variable, marks the occurrence of coronary heart disease during the study, noted as 1 for occurrence and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification and Retionalization\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation employs Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD), leveraging their distinct yet complementary strengths. Logistic Regression, a fundamental yet powerful tool in the realm of binary classification, is adept at discerning the presence or absence of CVD. It offers interpretability in the form of class probabilities, an indispensable attribute in clinical diagnostics for quantifying and understanding individual risk factors. Conversely, kNN serves as a valuable counterpart, renowned for its straightforward approach and proficiency in capturing complex, non-linear interactions between variables – a characteristic frequently observed in clinical datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics and Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the critical nature of accurately identifying at-risk patients, the study prioritizes recall as the primary evaluation metric. In CVD prediction, the cost of false negatives – overlooking individuals who are actually at risk – is exceedingly high, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Therefore, recall, which measures the model's ability to detect all positive cases, emerges as the most pertinent metric for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the scikit-learn Python package {cite}Pedregosa2012, this research benefits from its extensive suite of machine learning tools. This package not only provides efficient implementations of Logistic Regression and kNN but also encompasses a broad spectrum of data pre-processing techniques and metrics for comprehensive model evaluation, all encapsulated within an intuitive framework conducive to streamlined model development and assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing and Feature Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "A thorough preprocessing protocol is adopted to ensure the data's suitability for analysis. This includes addressing missing values in numerical attributes through median imputation, a decision driven by the skewed nature of certain variables, notably the cigarette consumption (CIG). This approach preserves the underlying distribution of these features. Additionally, to counter the diverse range of scales across various numerical features, the dataset undergoes normalization using StandardScaler. This normalization ensures equitable representation of each feature in the model, preventing any single variable from exerting undue influence due to scale disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the study incorporates OneHotEncoding for the categorical variable SEX, utilizing the drop=\"if_binary\" parameter. This efficient transformation yields a binary-encoded column, aligning with the analytical requirements of Logistic Regression and kNN models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparamer Optimization and Over-Sample Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In optimizing the Logistic Regression model, we employed grid search to fine-tune the regularization parameter (C), exploring a logarithmic range from 10^-4 to 10^5. The optimization, executed via GridSearchCV, was crucial for identifying the optimal C value, thereby enhancing model generalizability and mitigating overfitting risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model, we focused on optimizing the number of neighbors (n_neighbors). A cross-validation approach was applied across a range of 1 to 50 neighbors, in increments of 5, to determine the ideal balance between underfitting and overfitting, thus ascertaining the most effective neighbor count for accurate classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address class imbalance in the kNN model, we implemented Random Over Sampling (ROS), ensuring an equitable class distribution in the training set. This approach significantly enhanced the model’s ability to detect the minority class, a prevalent challenge in medical datasets with disproportionate class sizes."

    "A specific parameter (C) was determined using Gridsearch to optimize the model.\n",
    "The optimized logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 53.1%.\n",
    "It exhibited high recall but low precision, indicating it was better at identifying true cases of CVD but also had a higher rate of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial k-NN model showed a decent accuracy of around 79% but suffered from very low recall, leading to a significant number of false negatives.\n",
    "To address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset, oversampling was applied.\n",
    "After oversampling, the recall of the model improved notably, indicating fewer false negatives. However, this improvement came at the cost of reduced overall accuracy (64%).\n",
    "Based on the results of these models, we would rather suggest to employ Logistic Regression with the class_weight argument due to its superior recall. However, it's important to note that both model are poorly performing on the accuracy score. Thus, for subsequent analyses, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into the specific features and their contributions to predictions or conduct additional data preprocessing to refine the model's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the underlying cause of this unsatisfactory' result is likely rooted in the inherent characteristics of the data set. The features may not be too informative or sufficient for predicting whether a patient suffers from a coronary heart disease. The features provide more of an indication of whether a person is at risk for coronary heart disease. Therefore, it would probably result in a better model to have multiple variables in the target, indicating whether a patient already shows initial signs of the disease, rather than using a binary classification mode"

    "\n",
    "In medical diagnostics, especially for critical conditions like coronary heart disease, the priority is often to minimize false negatives as we aim to minimize instances where patients miss critical treatment. Thus, in our analysis we tried different measures to increase the recall. However, the relatively moderate accuracy levels (53.1% for logistic regression and 64% for KNN after oversampling) might be lower than what one might expect for medical diagnostic tools. This could result from the imbalance in class distribution and needs to be evaluated within the specific application to determine whether this low accuracy is acceptable. Such an evaluation should also contains an estimation of the incurred costs, that arise by having false positive/false negatives and approach to minimize these costs."
